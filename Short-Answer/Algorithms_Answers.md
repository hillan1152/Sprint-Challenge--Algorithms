#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) -- the size of n determines the size of the loop


b) O(log n) -- No matter how hight n gets, the while loop with "j" will never surpass the parameter "m." It will not increase exponentially.

c) O(n) -- runs based on the size of bunnies

## Exercise II

Since the goal is to minimize the amount of broken eggs, . If the egg doesn't break (False), continue to the next floor and forgo the process until the first egg breaks. If the egg breaks is True, and return -1 to get the floor where the egg doesn't break. This is linear search.

The run time complexity would be O(n) because we are unsure about the number of floors and n will dictate what floor it will land on.
